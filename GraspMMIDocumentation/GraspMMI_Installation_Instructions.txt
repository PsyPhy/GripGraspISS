To install the GraspMMI:

1) Copy the contents of this directory to the desired location on the host machine. 
   May be on a write-protected partition.
2) Create a directory in a writeable location to hold the captured packets sent by EPM.
   Edit the variable 'CacheDir' in RunGraspMMI.bat to point to the new location.
3) Perform initial test using the CLWS emulator and previously captured packets by executing RunGraspMMI.bat.
4) Exit all 3 processes.
5) Edit RunGraspMMI.bat to inhibit the CLWS emulator and to connect to the CLWS on 
   the appropriate IP address, port number and EPM software subunit ID. 
6) Start CLWS on EPM, GraspASW on DEX and GraspGUI on Perspectives.
7) Execute RunGraspMMI.bat.

NOTE 1: If a shortcut to RunGraspMMI.bat is created and placed elsewhere (e.g. the
  desktop, the "Execute in" parameter must point to the directory where RunGraspMMI.bat is located.

NOTE 2: There are extensive comments in RunGraspMMI.bat to guide efforts to edit
  according to the instructions above.
