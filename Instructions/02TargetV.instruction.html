<em><strong>Step 2: Acquire the Target Orientation</strong></em>
</p>
<p>Once your head is aligned with your body (i.e. when the halo is bright green), a set of parallel bars will appear at the end of the tunnel, representing the target orientation.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<p>Memorise the target orientation.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Your hand must remain in the neutral position on your lap throughout the target presentation. Please <em><strong>do not</strong></em> align your hand to the target orientation during target presentation or during the memory delay period.</p>
