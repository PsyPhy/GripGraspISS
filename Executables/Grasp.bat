REM Now write the files to a directory on DEX, using the root filename to select which files to write.
REM Find the filename root amongst the parameters.
REM The GraspGUI shell puts the results file root in the form --output=FNROOT.
REM Note that the '=' is treated as a blank by the command processor.
REM We therefore look for '--ouput' and then take the next parameter as the rootname.
