To install the GripMMI:

1) Copy the contents of this directory to the desired location on the host machine. 
   May be on a write-protected partition.
2) Create a directory in a writeable location to hold the captured packets sent by EPM.
   Edit the variable 'CacheDir' in RunGraspMMI.bat to point to the new location.
3) Perform initial test using the CLWS emulator and previously captured packets by executing RunGripMMI.bat.
4) Exit all 3 processes.
5) Edit RunGripMMI.bat to inhibit the CLWS emulator and to connect to the CLWS on 
   the appropriate IP address, port number and EPM software subunit ID. 
6) Start CLWS on EPM and start up the DEX payload in Grip mode.
7) Execute RunGripMMI.bat.

NOTE 1: If a shortcut to RunGripMMI.bat is created and placed elsewhere (e.g. the
  desktop, the "Execute in" parameter must point to the directory where RunGripMMI.bat is located.

NOTE 2: The scripts found in the GripScripts directory must be identical to the scripts being
  used on the DEX payload.
  
NOTE 3: There are extensive comments in RunGraspMMI.bat to guide efforts to edit
  according to the instructions above.
